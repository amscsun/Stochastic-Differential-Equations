# Stochastic-Differential-Equations
This rep contains mostly solutions to some fun problems on stochastic differential equations. Some were solved simply for fun, some were solutions to problem sets and take-home exams for the courses I have taken.

## Solutions to Stochastic Calculus offered by UCLA MFE program
To learn about applications of SDE in finance, I found this great course offered by UCLA MEF program and its problem sets. So I read through their lecture notes and solved all the problems. I found this to be a great way of learning new materials.

## Solutions to Final Take-home Exams for "Numerical Methods in Stochastic Differential Equations"
This is a great course offered by Univesity of Maryland, College Park for MATH PhD students. It talked about 1) ways of simulating sample path familities of stochastic processes with infinite 1st variation 2) connections between PDE and stochastic processes and their numerical solutions 3) solving forward and back komogorov equations to find the time evolution of density function of a stochastic process and corresponding numerical methods.
